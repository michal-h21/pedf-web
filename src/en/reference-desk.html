<h1 id="loans">Reference desk</h1>

<p>The Reference Desk is situated on the ground floor to the left of the foyer in the building in Rettigova 4 Street. </p>

<h2>Registration </h2>

<p>To become a registered user, it is necessary to get a <a
href="http://www.cuni.cz/UKEN-163.html">Charles University identification
card</a> and apply to the <a href="https://library.cuni.cz/e-application/">Charles University Library application form</a>. The registration is valid in all CU
Libraries. </p>

<h2>UKAŽ – online catalog </h2>

<p>Charles University’s discovery service UKAŽ allows simultaneous searching of printed, digitized, and electronic resources available at CU. You can also log in to your library account here, where you can view and renew your loans, make requests, and more. </p>

<h2>Borrowing books </h2>

<p>The collections are located without free access to shelves; librarians deliver documents on request. You can search the records in UKAŽ - every book has its code number, which you can write down and hand to the librarian. Or you can also make a reservation in the <a href="lockers.html">smart lockers</a>  for the book via <a href="https://ukaz.cuni.cz/en/">UKAŽ</a>. </p>

<p>The period of outside loans is usually 30 days (regular loans); in-house loans can be read-only in the study room. You can make prolongation via your library account.  </p>

<h2>Returning books </h2>

<p>Books can be returned at the reference desk, or you can use a Bibliobox (situated next to the reception), which is available during the opening hours of the faculty. Documents handed back via Bibliobox are cut out of a user’s library account the next weekday. </p>
