<h1>How to pay late fees?</h1>

<p>You can pay the late fees in cash when visiting the library in person. We
also accept payment cards at the rental shop in the main building of the
Faculty of Education (M. Rettigov√° Street).</p>

<p>The amount can also be paid by transfer to account No. 107-3922010217 /
0100. Please state your personal UK number (reader ID) as a variable payment
symbol and your name in the note when paying.</p>
