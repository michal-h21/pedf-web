The memorial plaque, which we unveiled to the academic community on January 24,
2024, is the work of sculptor Radek Mužík. It commemorates the activities of
Assoc. Prof. Anna Grmelová (1947-2012) and Assoc. Prof. Josef Grmela
(1942-2020), who significantly contributed to the development of the Department
of English Language and Literature during the post-November period. Assoc.
Prof. Anna Grmelová, who led the department from 1993 to 2009, among other
achievements, initiated the establishment of a specialized study room for
English language and literature in 1995. You can view photographs from the
