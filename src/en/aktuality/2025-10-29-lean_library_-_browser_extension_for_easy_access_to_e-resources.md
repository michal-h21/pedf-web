Try the new [Lean Library](https://wiki.alma.cuni.cz/index.php?title=Lean_Library/en) browser extension that helps you access licensed electronic information resources (EIZ) of Charles University.
The extension automatically detects if the university has access to a requested article or e-book and offers login through EZproxy or another available route. It can also point you to legal open-access versions or printed copies available at CU libraries.

Lean Library works both on and off campus, for example when searching via Google Scholar or directly on publishers’ websites.

[Available](https://wiki.alma.cuni.cz/index.php?title=Lean_Library/en) for browsers:
Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Safari.
