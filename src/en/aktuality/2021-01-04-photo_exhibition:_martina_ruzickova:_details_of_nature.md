Martina Růžičková is a former employee of our library, an enthusiastic amateur
photographer. Last December, you could see an exhibition of her photographs
*Winter - color and black and white* - in our Small Gallery by the Studyroom. The
current exhibition presents her other favorite theme - plants and insects.
