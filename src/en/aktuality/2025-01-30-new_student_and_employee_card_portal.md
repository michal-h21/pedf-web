[The Student and Employee Card Portal](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1437.html) has been launched. You can now extend your
ISIC, ITIC, and ALIVE licenses online, order a new UK card, or
deactivate/activate this card. In UK libraries it is not yet possible to use
the ID card loaded on phones. The reason is the missing barcode. Thank you for
continuing to bring your plastic cards to the libraries.Â
