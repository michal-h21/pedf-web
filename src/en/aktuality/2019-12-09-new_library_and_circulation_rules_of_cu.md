Dear library user, we would like to inform you that the new Library and
Circulation Rules of CU become effective on the 1st of December 2019 (for
further information, please visit [https://cuni.cz/UK-10054.html](https://cuni.cz/UK-10054.html)). New rules are
bringing innovation to library services. From the 1st of December 2019, you
won't need a separate registration to each CU library, only one registration
for the use of CU libraries will be sufficient. Your current registration will
remain valid and will also be extended to every CU library. We believe that
this arrangement will facilitate access to literature and special collections
of CU libraries.
