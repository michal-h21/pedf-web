Because of a reconstruction of our Loan desk room between 3rd and 6th September
2019, we are ready to lend you books in the Study room during this time. It´s a
little bit challenge for us, but we look forward to seeing you, and to
newcomers in particular! We have automatically extended all borrowed books,
that should be returned at September 3th, 2019. A new due date for these books
is September 9th, 2019. Please feel free to use our big red box (Bibliobox)
next to the main entrance in the building, if you only want to return books and
you don´t need anything else in the library.
