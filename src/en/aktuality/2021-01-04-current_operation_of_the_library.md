Due to the current epidemiological situation, the library is completely closed.
We can lend books using [reservation boxes](lockers.html) on request.
[Electronic resources](catalogues.html) are available 24 hours a day. To return
books, use the bibliobox next to the gatehouse, or you can send them by mail.
You can pay any [late fees](fees.html) by bank transfer. Do not hesitate to use our online
counseling center via FB [@knihovnapedfpraha](https://www.facebook.com/knihovnapedfpraha)! We advise on access to
e-resources, citations and discuss the availability of literature with you.
