The library at M. Rettigové 4 will be closed, along with the entire building,
starting from July 1, 2025. It will reopen no earlier than the second half of
September. Due to reconstruction, access to the books at M. Rettigové 4 will
not be possible during this entire period.

June will therefore be the last opportunity to stock up on books for the autumn
(e.g., for exams or the winter semester). We are currently extending the loan
period for all books until October 1, 2025.

**Good news: The study room in Celetná 13 will remain open throughout the entire
period, every working day from 9 AM to 3 PM. Printing, ring binding and other
usual services will be available there.**

An exception will be July 17 and 18, 2025, when the Celetná study room will be
closed due to the regular library collection inventory.
