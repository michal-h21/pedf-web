been several changes in the operation of libraries and library services. All
libraries in the main building will remain closed until at least the end of
January 2024. Books and notebooks can be returned at the

Latin and Greek Studies of the Faculty of Arts</a> a temporary reading room for
interlibrary loan services has been operating since 8 January.
