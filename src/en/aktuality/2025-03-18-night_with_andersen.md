We warmly invite the children and grandchildren of faculty employees to the
Night with Andersen 2025, which will take place on March 28, 2025. In addition
to spending the night in the study room, we will have a literary game – this
time based on the book "Mr. Lepron’s Soup" by Giovanna Zoboli. Recommended age
of children: 6-12 years. You can find the registration [form here](https://forms.office.com/e/RWBwh8Kv5N?origin=lprLink).
