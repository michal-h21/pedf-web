The library will reopen on January 6, 2025. If you have reserved books in the
circulation boxes, you may check them out on January 2 and 3, 2025 from 8 a.m.
to 3 p.m. Thank you so much for your year-round patronage. You visited us
29,643 times in 2024 in the study rooms alone, which is 1,000 more visits than
last year. We look forward to seeing you again and will continue to strive to
create the best possible learning environment for you. Â
