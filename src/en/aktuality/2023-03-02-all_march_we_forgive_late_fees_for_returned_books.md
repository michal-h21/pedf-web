As part of March - Readers' Month, we are announcing a reading amnesty. Users
who return books borrowed from the Faculty of Education Library (including the
study room in Celetna) during March 2023 will not be charged for the late fees
attached to them. Books can be returned in the lending room or to biblioboxes.
The bibliobox for returning books can be found in M. Rettigové next to the
reception desk, the bibliobox in Celetná 13 is outside the entrance to our
attic study room.
