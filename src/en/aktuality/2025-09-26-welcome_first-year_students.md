We look forward to your first visit to the faculty library. You’re welcome to
stop by anytime just to have a look around, or you can come with your
registration already completed – by filling out [this simple online form](https://library.cuni.cz/e-application/), 
you’ll immediately become a registered reader at all libraries of Charles University.
All you need is your student ID (ISIC card).
