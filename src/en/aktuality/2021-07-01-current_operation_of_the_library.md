Our Library Window is open again. You can order books via
the [catalog](https://ckis.cuni.cz/F/?func=file&file_name=find-a&CON_LNG=ENG)
and wait for an e-mail that books are ready for You to pick up. We can lend
books using [Smart Lockers](lockers.html) on request. [Electronic Resources](catalogues.html) are available 24
hours a day. To return books, use the bibliobox next to the gatehouse. You
can also send them by mail. You can pay any [late fees](fees.html) by bank transfer. Do not
hesitate to use our online counseling center via [FB @knihovnapedfpraha](https://www.facebook.com/knihovnapedfpraha)! We
help with access to e-resources, citations and discuss the availability of
literature with you.
