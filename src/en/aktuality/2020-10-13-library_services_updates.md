The library is closed until further anouncement due to the current COVID 19 related restrictions.
Every soon to be expired loan period of your external loans is extended until the end of November (as well as your loans
from our libraries outside Prague). The lending services are not 
possible at the moment. You can hand back your borrowed books and documents
through Bibliobox only. Feel free to write or call us shoud you have any
questions. You can also go to our facebook page ([@knihovnapedfpraha](https://www.facebook.com/knihovnapedfpraha)), where you
can send us a message. We are ready to help you from afar!
