The library (lending services) is open every Monday and Wednesday from 9 a.m.
to 3 p.m. Our study rooms are closed. Every soon to be expired loan period of
your external loans is extended until the end of October (as well as your loans
from our libraries outside Prague). The lending services are available only
through prior reservation, borrowing books on request in the library is not
possible at the moment. You can hand back your borrowed books and documents
through Bibliobox only. Feel free to write or call us shoud you have any
questions. You can also go to our facebook page ([@knihovnapedfpraha](https://www.facebook.com/knihovnapedfpraha)), where you
can send us a message. We are ready to help you from afar!
