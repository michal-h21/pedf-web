We want to remain a safe place for everyone. Therefore, as a precaution, the
library will remain closed until the test results on COVID 19 are received. You
can still return books to the Bibliobox. We will inform you about the operation
in the following week on Monday, September 28, at the latest. Thank you for
your understanding.
