We recommend you to reserve a book in advance for avoding waiting in the queue.

How to order books:

Open CU Central Catalogue. Search the book and make a request for the
book situated in FEdu Magdalény Rettigové or FEdu Celetná.

Always return books to the library you borrowed them from. In
Magdalény Rettigové, you can return the books in the Bibliobox which
is situated next to the reception desk.
