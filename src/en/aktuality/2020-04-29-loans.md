Book loans are available for all Charles University students again. The loaning
desk is open every Monday and Wednesday from 9.00 to 15.00. 

Books have to be
ordered in advance via the [CU Central Catalogue](https://ckis.cuni.cz/F/8VS6TJL11VBAGNAQVX4EVGUR8M536Y2F2QIUSVSXT44JRI6X8H-35435?RN=563431407&pds_handle=GUEST&CON_LNG=ENG).
When you find a book in the catalogue, make sure it is located in *FEdu M.
Rettigov√©*. To make the request, choose the option [*Request*  on
the left side](/img/library-request.png) of the web page. The value in the *Due date* column has to be *On shelf*. When the
reservation is ready, we will send you a confirmation e-mail with further instructions.

All loans are prolonged as necessary until the library is open again. Borrowed
books can be returned only in the Bibliobox next to the reception desk.
