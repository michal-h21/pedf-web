According to the quickly changing nature of the situation, the deanÂ´s college
on March 10, 2020 decided: The PedF UK building will be accessible only to
teachers and staff with their Staff Card. Students are not allowed in the
building. All books borrowed from the library are licensed to keep until April 6.
There is no need to return them in the original date. Please feel free to use
